#Setup Solr

Setting up solr and then configuring to work with a drupal installation seems a bit of a pain so rather than suffer the same problems each time I wrote this script to at least get me most of the way there.


###Note

Where changes are required to a file, I have prompted to make them manually, and provided some copy and paste code and opened the file. It is a bit slower, but it means I keep track of what has happened and can modify if necessary (May well replace with patches if I end up doing the same thing again and again).
